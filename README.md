# POC Spear-Phishing
A proof of concept to show how spear-phishing attacks can target RPA automations.

This repository serves as a reference to an article on the topic of spear-phishing on RPA robots. 

The article: https://rpaftw.com/blog/rpa-vulnerable-to-phishing

As it is explained on the article, the project has implemented a domain list for validation  for overcome the possible problem. ([trusted_domains.xlsx](https://github.com/fabio-condez/POC_SpearPhishing/blob/main/Data/trusted_domains.xlsx)).



## Contributions:

As this repository serves as support material to the article, probably I will not accept  improvements that would drastically change the behavior of the project.

Other than that, every contribution is welcome ðŸ˜Š
